description: Less than a year after landing at Jamestown, Captain John Smith arrives
  in Werowocomoco ("meeting place of chiefs"), in what will become Gloucester County.
  He is a prisoner of Chief Powatan, a powerful leader of Indians throughout eastern
  Virginia. Smith later asserts that he was saved from execution by the intercessions
  of Powatan's young daughter, Pocahontas. The location of Werowocomoco is variously
  ascribed to the present Wicomico region around Shelly or possibly at Purtan Bay
  (previously "Poetan", which may have derived from "Powatan"). According to legend,
  the ancient "Powatan's Chimney" in Wicomico is the remains of a house known to have
  been built by Dutchmen at the direction of Captain Smith as a peace offering to
  the Indian chief, but archeaological evidence does not support that.
